3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, 
according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a piece of memory that acts like a server. It has software installed on it and is basically a computer, but without any extraneous hardware. A VPS can run python and applications and tools. It can be made to receive and respond to requests. 

4. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

The root user has access to everywhere and everything, so programs run by this user make your have access everything (and can destroy everything). Vulnerabilities to viruses or bugs are very consequential. 

It's best practice to run applications on a user level and reserve the root user for administrative tasks.
