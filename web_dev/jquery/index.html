    <p>Among the <strong>prisoners</strong> were a number of priests, and Joan took these under her protection and saved their <strong>lives</strong>. It was urged that they were most probably <strong>combatants</strong> in disguise, but she said:</p>
    <p>"As to that, how can any tell? They wear the livery of God, and if even one of these wears it rightfully, surely it were better that all the guilty should escape than that we have upon our hands the <em>blood</em> of that <em>innocent man</em>. I will lodge them where I lodge, and feed them, and sent them away in safety."</p>
    <p>We marched back to the city with our crop of <em>cannon</em> and <strong>prisoners</strong> on view and our <strong>banners</strong> displayed. Here was the first substantial bit of <em>war-work</em> the <em>imprisoned people</em> had seen in the seven months that the siege had endured, the first chance they had had to rejoice over a French exploit. You may guess that they made good use of it. They and the <strong>bells</strong> went mad. Joan was their darling now, and the press of people struggling and shouldering each other to get a glimpse of her was so great that we could hardly push our way through the <strong>streets</strong> at all. Her new name had gone all about, and was on everybody's lips. The Holy Maid of Vaucouleurs was a forgotten title; the city had claimed her for its own, and she was the <em>MAID OF ORLEANS</em> now. It is a happiness to me to remember that I heard that name the first time it was ever uttered. Between that first utterance and the last time it will be uttered on this earthâ€”ah, think how many <strong>moldering ages</strong> will lie in that <em>gap</em>!</p>
    <p>The Boucher family welcomed her back as if she had been a child of the house, and saved from death against all hope or probability. They chided her for going into the <em>battle</em> and exposing herself to <em>danger</em> during all those hours. They could not realize that she had meant to carry her <em>warriorship</em> so far, and asked her if it had really been her purpose to go right into the <em>turmoil</em> of the <em>fight</em>, or hadn't she got swept into it by <em>accident</em> and the <em>rush</em> of the <strong>troops</strong>? They begged her to be more careful another time. It was good advice, maybe, but it fell upon <em>pretty unfruitful soil</em>.</p>
