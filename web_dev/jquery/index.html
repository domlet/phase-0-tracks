    <p>"Waste no more time, man—let the <strong>bugles</strong> sound the <em>assault</em>!" and we saw that strange deep light in her eye which we named the <em>battle-light</em>, and learned to know so well in later <strong>fields</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>The <strong>martial notes</strong> pealed out, the <strong>troops</strong> answered with a <em>yell</em>, and down they came against that <em>formidable work</em>, whose <strong>outlines</strong> were lost in its own <em>cannon-smoke</em>, and whose sides were spouting <em>flame</em> and <em>thunder</em>.</p>
    <p>
        We suffered <em>repulse</em> after <em>repulse</em>, but Joan was here and there and everywhere encouraging the men, and she kept them to their work. During three hours the <em>tide</em> ebbed and flowed, flowed and ebbed; but at last La Hire, who was now come, made a final and resistless <em>charge</em>, and the <em>bastille St. Loup</em> was ours. We gutted it, taking all its <strong>stores</strong> and artillery, and then destroyed it.</p>
    <p>
        When all our host was shouting itself hoarse with <strong>rejoicings</strong>, and there went up a cry for the General, for they wanted to praise her and glorify her and do her homage for her <em>victory</em>, we had trouble to find her; and when we did find her, she was off by herself, sitting among a ruck of <strong>corpses</strong>, with her face in her <strong>hands</strong>, crying—for she was a young girl, you know, and her hero heart was a young girl's heart too, with the pity and the tenderness that are natural to it. She was thinking of the mothers of those <em>dead friends</em> and <strong>enemies</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        Among the <strong>prisoners</strong> were a number of priests, and Joan took these under her protection and saved their <strong>lives</strong>. It was urged that they were most probably <strong>combatants</strong> in disguise, but she said:</p>
    <p>
        "As to that, how can any tell? They wear the livery of God, and if even one of these wears it rightfully, surely it were better that all the guilty should escape than that we have upon our hands the <em>blood</em> of that <em>innocent man</em>. I will lodge them where I lodge, and feed them, and sent them away in safety."</p>
    <p>
        We marched back to the city with our crop of <em>cannon</em> and <strong>prisoners</strong> on view and our <strong>banners</strong> displayed. Here was the first substantial bit of <em>war-work</em> the <em>imprisoned people</em> had seen in the seven months that the siege had endured, the first chance they had had to rejoice over a French exploit. You may guess that they made good use of it. They and the <strong>bells</strong> went mad. Joan was their darling now, and the press of people struggling and shouldering each other to get a glimpse of her was so great that we could hardly push our way through the <strong>streets</strong> at all. Her new name had gone all about, and was on everybody's lips. The Holy Maid of Vaucouleurs was a forgotten title; the city had claimed her for its own, and she was the <em>MAID OF ORLEANS</em> now. It is a happiness to me to remember that I heard that name the first time it was ever uttered. Between that first utterance and the last time it will be uttered on this earth—ah, think how many <strong>moldering ages</strong> will lie in that <em>gap</em>!</p>
    <p>
        The Boucher family welcomed her back as if she had been a child of the house, and saved from death against all hope or probability. They chided her for going into the <em>battle</em> and exposing herself to <em>danger</em> during all those hours. They could not realize that she had meant to carry her <em>warriorship</em> so far, and asked her if it had really been her purpose to go right into the <em>turmoil</em> of the <em>fight</em>, or hadn't she got swept into it by <em>accident</em> and the <em>rush</em> of the <strong>troops</strong>? They begged her to be more careful another time. It was good advice, maybe, but it fell upon <em>pretty unfruitful soil</em>.</p>
