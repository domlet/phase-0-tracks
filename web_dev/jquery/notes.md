1. Make a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours.

- watch some videos (youtube, khan)

- do all the preparatory work here:
https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-js-jquery/jquery-intro/a/are-you-ready-to-learn-jquery

- look for a sample project

2. Make a jQuery project and add it to the jquery directory. It can be tiny, and it can do whatever you like.
