What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
- they give semantic structure to the page and the elements on it
- they help blind people and machines with no eyes use, navigate, understand and access the content and the structure
- most useful: nav, header, footer, article, section, aside seems cool

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
- top to bottom

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll 
create more handy snippets at a later date?
- snippets are awesome
- we learned new tricks for select-all and replace-all (and some)

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
- I actually don't understand the order the browser uses to display elements on a page. For seeming like a simple question, this yields very convoluted responses. Seems like CSS reads bottom-to-top, and browsers may read however they like, in random order, even.
