<h1>Hello world</h1>
<h2>Important details:</h2>
<p><strong>Once upon a time <em>I went to Asia.</em></strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>I bought a one-way ticket to Korea because I knew there would be WiFi there, and I wanted to get <a href="http://dombrassey.com">some writing</a> done.</li>
  <li>Then I flew to Beijing to visit for only 72 hours. I ate a giant beetle on a stick.</li>
  <li>I arrived in the Philippines without my ATM card because I left that in the 1980s ATM machine at the Great Wall of China.</li>
  <li>After the Philippines I visited Hong Kong, where my mother's family is from. We emigrated to escape being murdered in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>.</li>
  <li>Last, I visited Thailand and taught English language in K-6 classrooms in exchange for room and board.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips for having your quarter-life crisis abroad, should you be so lucky:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don't cancel your insurance plans. Your rates will go up when you come back.</li>
  <li>Get your visas months in advance, before you leave the USA.</li>
  <li>Don't go "jogging" in rural Thailand. Wild dogs will chase you and bite you. Gross.</li>
  <li>Visit Japan. I regret not visiting Kyoto when I was nearby.</li>
</ul>
