### write the algorithm for using an elevator ###

# define locations

space = {x,y,z}
beg_dest = {1,-2,0}
end_dest = {1,-2,15}
elevator = {0,0,0; 0,2,0; 2,2,0; 2,0,0}
min_dest = {1,-2,0}
max_dest = {1,-2,20}

# enter elevator

if doorisopen = false
request = up
otherwise
occupy elevator

# push button for destination

request = end_dest

# exit elevator

if location = x,x,15
and
doorisopen = true
occupy end_dest
