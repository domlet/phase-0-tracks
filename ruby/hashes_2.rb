# Your program should ...
# Prompt the designer/user for all info
# Convert user input to appropriate data type.
# Print hash to screen when done.
# Give the user the opportunity to update a key (no need to loop, once is fine). After all, sometimes users make mistakes! If the designer says "none", skip it. But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. (Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) You can assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.
# Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.
# Be sure to pseudocode, and leave your pseudocode in as comments.
