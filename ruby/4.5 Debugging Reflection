Consider the workflow advice above, and compare it to your coding process so far. 

1. Good: I test my code often. I like to confirm my victories and correct my misunderstandings.
2. Good: I think I name my variables well; contextual without being overly-specific.
3. Bad: I don't commit often enough. My code is broken so much of the time, I'm not always thinking "this is a great time to commit."

How can your workflow improve? What mistakes have caused you the most trouble in the past? 

1. Walking away from troubled or broken code with fixes in process, and not knowing what the hell is going on next time I look at it.

2. Accidentally working on the master branch.

Write a paragraph or two about flaws in your workflow and how you plan to break any bad habits. 

1. Commenting while de-bugging is brilliant; this is something I can do.

2. Leaving myself more notes in general is a better way for me to communicate with my future-workflow-self.
