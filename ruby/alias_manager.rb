# pseudocode and write a method "Felicia Torres"
# creates a fake name with it 
# by doing the following:

# Swap first and last name
# Change all the vowels to the next vowel in 'aeiou' 
# Change all of the consonants (everything else besides the vowels) 
# to the next consonant in the alphabet. 
# So 'a' would become 'e', 'u' would become 'a', and 'd' would become 'f'.
