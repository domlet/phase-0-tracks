# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control enables designated "save points" where the code is happy or functional, as opposed to in-progress or broken. This is extremely useful because your code might be beautiful until you try adding a new feature. In trying you may create an apocalypse and break the very thing you love. It's useful to have a memory of the thing you love so you aren't left only with the thing you destroyed.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a version of your codebase that is undergoing change. You should create a branch when more than one person is working on the codebase so that you can change things independently, and then merge your changes. In doing so you combine your separate forces and achieve a greater good.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is an action that creates a "save point" or version for your code, to which you may later return if needed. Commits make time travel possible.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a problem that arises when different devs have made different changes to the same code. Instead of combining forces, you have entangled forces which must be manually unentangled.
