The unconscious derelict slumped in defecate. Contaminated, contagious people. Stuttering lunatics and howling ghosts. 
# We walk by the living. We pay money to watch #TheWalkingDead. We give guns to police because we want someone to wash our sins from the Earth. Every great wall is a monument to what we are willing to sacrifice for wealth.
