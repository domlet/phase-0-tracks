Run a SQL query for each of the following:

1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

sqlite> SELECT * FROM books;

1|Eloquent JavaScript|false|1|1
2|The Well-Grounded Rubyist|false|1|1
3|I Love Dick|true|1|2
4|The Water Knife|true|1|2
5|The Things They Carried|false|1|3
6|Then Comes Marriage|false|1|3

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> UPDATE books SET qty=5 WHERE title="The Water Knife";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM books;

1|Eloquent JavaScript|false|1|1
2|The Well-Grounded Rubyist|false|1|1
3|I Love Dick|true|1|2
4|The Water Knife|true|5|2
5|The Things They Carried|false|1|3
6|Then Comes Marriage|false|1|3

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT * from books, genres WHERE books.genre_id = genres.id;

1|Eloquent JavaScript|false|1|1|1|Computer Science
2|The Well-Grounded Rubyist|false|1|1|1|Computer Science
3|I Love Dick|true|1|2|2|Fiction
4|The Water Knife|true|5|2|2|Fiction
5|The Things They Carried|false|1|3|3|Memoir
6|Then Comes Marriage|false|1|3|3|Memoir

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

sqlite> SELECT books.title, genres.genre FROM books JOIN genres ON books.genre_id = genres.id;

Eloquent JavaScript|Computer Science
The Well-Grounded Rubyist|Computer Science
I Love Dick|Fiction
The Water Knife|Fiction
The Things They Carried|Memoir
Then Comes Marriage|Memoir

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

sqlite> DELETE FROM books WHERE title="I Love Dick";
sqlite> SELECT * FROM books;

1|Eloquent JavaScript|false|1|1
2|The Well-Grounded Rubyist|false|1|1
4|The Water Knife|true|5|2
5|The Things They Carried|false|1|3
6|Then Comes Marriage|false|1|3

1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?

- INCLUSIVE FULL JOIN
- EXCLUSIVE FULL JOIN
- NO JOIN
- INNER JOIN
- INCLUSIVE RIGHT (OR LEFT) JOIN
- EXCLUSIVE RIGHT (OR LEFT) JOIN

2. Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands and the output in queries.txt.

// ATTEMPTED EXCLUSIVE FULL JOIN:

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reading_list_1 FULL JOIN reading_list_2 ON reading_list_1.title = reading_list_2.title WHERE reading_list_2.title IS NULL OR reading_list_1.title IS NULL;

Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported
sqlite> 

---

// ATTEMPTED EXCLUSIVE INNER JOIN:

sqlite> SELECT * FROM reading_list_1 INNER JOIN reading_list_2 ON reading_list_1.title = reading_list_2.title;
